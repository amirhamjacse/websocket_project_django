## Installation

To get the project running locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-room.git
   ```
   
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   Alternatively, you can serve it through a local server for better performance with WebSockets.

## How It Works

1. **Room Creation**: The app prompts users to enter a room name and device name when first loaded. You can change the room anytime by clicking on the "Change Room" button.
2. **Messaging**: Type a message in the textarea and click "Send" or press Enter to send the message. Images can also be sent by selecting an image from the file input.
3. **Image Viewing**: When an image is received, it is displayed in the chat log as a thumbnail. Clicking on the image will open a modal where you can zoom in and download the image.
4. **Emoji Support**: You can add emojis to your messages using the emoji picker button.
5. **Responsive**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly, making it suitable for use on phones and tablets.

## Usage

- **Send a message**: Type your message and click "Send" or press Enter.
- **Send an image**: Click the attachment icon and choose an image from your device.
- **Zoom image**: Click on any image in the chat to open it in a zoom modal.
- **Change room**: Click the "Change Room" button to create a new chat room.
